    <p class ="abtMe">
        My name is Easan Hamkins and I am currently a freshman at Crescenta Valley High School.
        I am a dedicated, hard working student who is deeply interested in STEM activities.
        This website is a project I decided to build for the AP Computer Science course I am taking this year.
        On this site, I have some basic info about me, my resume, and some cool other features that I found interesting. 
        I will continue to use this website and hope to improve on it soon. Hope you enjoy!!
